This repo contains build scripts to compile [Tesseract](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract) and it's dependencies for Apple platforms to be distributed as a Swift package. It's primary goal is to aide in migrating [SwiftyTesseract](https://github.com/SwiftyTesseract/SwiftyTesseract) to be consumable as a Swift Package Manager dependency. If you're looking for looking for a quick way to get started with using Tesseract in your Apple platform application without the rough edges of memory management and dealing with C interop, then you should start with SwiftyTesseract.

## Installation
Add libtesseract as a Swift Package Dependency
```swift
// Package.swift
// swift-tools-version:5.3
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.
import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "AwesomePackage",
  platforms: [
    .macOS(.v10_15),
    .iOS(.v13),
  ],
  products: [
    .library(
      name: "AwesomePackage",
      targets: ["AwesomePackage"]
    ),
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/SwiftyTesseract/libtesseract.git", from: "0.1.0")
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "AwesomePackage",
      dependencies: ["libtesseract"]
    ),
  ]
)

// AwesomePackage.swift
import libtesseract
```
### Additional Required Configuration
You must link against the following libraries:
* libc++
* libz

This can be done in an xcode-based project by adding these in Build Phases -> Link Binary with Libaries

See SwiftyTesseract's [Additonal Configuration](https://github.com/SwiftyTesseract/SwiftyTesseract#additional-configuration) notes on considerations for including language training data files.
